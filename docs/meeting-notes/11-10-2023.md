# Metrics to use

- For total node power consumption we are using  `avg(1 - rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (instance)` coming from node_metrics
    - What's the difference between mode="idle"
    - What's the difference between mode="iowait"
    - Should we use `1 - rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])`

- For CPU utilization what's the difference between?
    - kepler_node_core_joules_total
    - kepler_node_dram_joules_total
    - kepler_node_package_joules_total
    - kepler_node_other_joules_total
    - kepler_node_platform_joules_total
    - kepler_node_uncore_joules_total
